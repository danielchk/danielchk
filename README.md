## About me

I'm a person with a big passion to develop, with these projects you will see some initiatives and ideas through my learning with the help of Holberton school. My passion to develop started when I saw the world of videogames and when I was working in the IT office of the Almacenes Exito", in this moment I felt the need and the curiosity to learn about this. In this github you will see many projects, some good practices, maybe good codes but also errors or maybe too bad practices, but the important thing here is my process of learning and always being better, this is not only code or bits, this is a dream.
